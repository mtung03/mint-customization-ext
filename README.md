Feature List

In Progress:
 - Toggle for month-to-month rollover in Budgets. I want to easily be able
   to switch from viewing my Budgets with the current spending for this month
   and incorporating the spending from last month as a rollover. Currently
   each individual budget needs to be set or unset from this feature.

Todo:
 - Regex for Rules. You can set rules that automatically re-categorize
   or hide certain transactions, but the functionality is limited to an
   exact text match of whatever the default description is. I would like
   to make a rule that can use Regex to partial match a transaction description

 - Simpler visualization for Spending by Category. Currently the only way to
   view the spending by category is through a pie chart that you need to hover
   over and click through to see exact numbers and sub-categories. I would like
   to display this data in a better way, possibly with line items and a collapsible
   folder-like structure.
